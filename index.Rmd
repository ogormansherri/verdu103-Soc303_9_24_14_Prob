## Administration Items

1. Homework 1 is due Next Monday!
2. Today, we are covering Probability, Hypothesis, and Research Methods (briefly!)
3. You will have lab time again to work on your homework....keep working on it :)
4. Next Week: Chapters 7 and 8 :)
5. Keep working on the research part of your drafts.

## Probability Key Concepts

* Experiment: process by which an observation (or measurement) is obtained.
* Simple Event: the outcome that is observed on a single repetition of the experiment.
* Event: collection of simple events.
* Mutually Exclusive: when one event occurs, the other cannot, and vice versa.
* S: set of all simple events.
* Probability of an event *A* is equal to the sum of the simple events contained in A.
* The *union* of events A and B, denoted by $A \cup B$ = either A or B occurring.
* The *intersection* of events A and B, denoted by $A \cap B$ = BOTH A AND B OCCUR.
* The *complement* of an event A = $A^C$ ... where A does not occur!

## Key Concepts, continued

* Independent: Two events, A and B, are said to be *independent* if and only if the probability of event B is not influenced or changed by the occurrence of event A, or vice versa.
* Random Variable: A variable x is a *random variable* if the value that it assumes, corresponding to the outcome of an experiment, is a chance or random event.
* Experiment: process by which an observation or measurement is obtained.

## Probability 

* In previous Chapters we introduced topics such as qualitative (Nominal and Ordinal) and quantitative (Interval and Ratio) variables. Today, we are talking about Discrete Random Variables and Their Probability Distributions. 
* However, even qualitative variables can generate numerical data if the categories are numerically coded to form a scale. For example, if you toss a single coin, the qualitative outcome could be recorded as “0” if a head and “1” if a tail.
* We can record outcomes and describe the results using probability and statistics.

## Concepts

An experiment is the process by which an observation or measurement is obtained.

Examples:

1. Recording weight
2. Recording vital signs in the E.R.
3. Recording an opinion (yes or no)
4. Toss two coins
5. Values for a card

## Simple Events

These are the outcomes that are observed on a single repetition of the experiment. We can use a deck of cards to record values for probability and statistical purposes :)

* The basic element to which probability is applied.
* One and only one simple event can occur when the experiment is performed.

A simple event is denoted by E with a subscript. $E_a$.

Each simple event will be assigned a probability, measuring “how often” it occurs. 
The set of all simple events of an experiment is called the  sample space, S.

## TOSSING A COIN

Outcome     | Frequency
------------|----------
$E_{Head}$  | number
$E_{Tail}$  | number

S = {$E_{Head}$, $E_{Tail}$}

## Events

A collection of simple events. For example a deck of cards.

* $\heartsuit$ Hearts: King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace
* $\clubsuit$ Clubs: King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace
* $\spadesuit$ Spades: King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace
* $\diamondsuit$ Diamonds: King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace

Total Cards = 52 (26 Black and 26 Red)

Basic probability without replacement for a red queen (think Alice in Wonderland):

![width](redqueen.jpeg)

P(Red) = 26/52 or ½ , P(Queen) is 4/52 or 1/13 so P(Red and Queen) = ½ * 1/13 = 1/26

## The Probability of an Event

The probability of an event A is found by adding the probabilities of all the simple events contained in A. 

* We can find probabilities by using:
    * Estimates from empirical studies
    * Common sense estimates based on equally likely events
* Coin Toss: P(Head) = 1/2 = .50 = 50%
* 10% of a sample have red hair: P(Red Hair) = 10% = .10

## For this class 

You will not be required to know probability theory, rather, you will be asked to engage in probability techniques through statistical analysis. This is a back story. Statistics is built on the probability that your hypotheses are set up in such a way, that you can see the probability that you accept or reject the null in favor of the alternative.

## Brief Example
In a certain population, 10% of the people can be classified as being high risk for a heart attack. Three people are randomly selected from this population. What is the probability that exactly one of the three are high risk?

* Let P = Probability and Set up definitions:
    * H = high risk and N = not high risk
* Set up the events:
    * P(H) = .10 
    * P(N) = .90
* Math: P(H) + P(N) = 1.0 --> .10 + .90 = 1.00 :)
    * P(exactly one high risk) = P(HNN) + P(NHN) + P(NNH)
    * = P(H)P(N)P(N) + P(N)P(H)P(N) + P(N)P(N)P(H)
    * = (.1)(.9)(.9) + (.9)(.1)(.9) + (.9)(.9)(.1)= 3(.1)(.9)2 = .243
* Answer: 0.243
